# harmony

Harmony package helps to build the tables and plots from alignment analysis designed for the multi-factor categorical case by extracting the Mplus output's information. 

## Installing

To install, type in the RStudio console:  
`devtools::install_github("hai-mn/harmony")`

Then call the package:  
`library(harmony)`

## Structure of The Package
The package has six main functions:
- `alignmentout()`: to generate table(s) with estimates, alignment values and R-square of Thresholds and Loadings
- `alignmentthresholdplot()`: to generate alignment threshold plots having True/False invariant with estimates of group items and invariant average
- `alignmentloadingplot()`: to generating alignment loading plot having True/False invariant with estimates of group items and invariant average
- `convert2irt()`: to convert IFA estimates (threshold and loading) to IRT estimates (difficulty and discrimination)
- `irc()`: to generate Cumulative and Category Item Probability (Characteristic/Response) Curve Plots
- `cellsizedetect()`: to check the 2 x 2 crosstabs of items having the cell size and below specified by the user   

In order to the package to functional, we recommend:  
- a Mplus output must have these parts:  
    1. INPUT INSTRUCTIONS
    2. SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS
    3. MODEL FIT INFORMATION
    4. MODEL RESULTS
    5. ALIGNMENT OUTPUT
    6. SAVEDATA INFORMATION
- naming your variable name in Mplus syntax (.inp) should not surpass 8 characters, for example __headstrg__ and __hypeactv__, instead of headstrong and hyperactive.  

- the labeling for alignment plots generated by alignmentplot() has to save in Excel file with 2 column names: __GroupNumber__ and __GroupLabel__
